## Downloading Larson et al's data

This study uses neural networks to process fibers in fiber beds, using Larson et al's data [1]. To be able to reproduce our study, it is necessary to download that data. For that, you will need a login at the [Globus](https://www.globus.org/) platform.

The dataset we used is available at http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.18126/M2QM0Z. The samples we used are available at `data/Recons/Bunch2WoPR`.
